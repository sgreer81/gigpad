INTRO:   Dm7        | Gsus        | Dm7        | Gsus

Verse 1:
You l[Dm7]ooked into the endless void, the w[Gsus]onder yet to be
And i[Dm7]n the dark Your ageless voice spread o[Gsus]ut the galaxies
A s[F]ea of stars bef[C/E]ore Your eyes, Your g[Dm7]lory filled the [Am]new[G]born [F]skies
And You s[C]aid, â€œ[C/E]It is g[F]ood,â€ and the e[Am]arth bears [F]witness: [G]It is finished.[C        | Am    F]

Verse 2:
You l[Dm7]ooked into the c[F]rucible that b[Gsus]urned with agony
You h[Dm7]umbly chose the F[F]ather's will and c[Gsus]limbed to Calvary
Your b[F]lood for all my s[C/E]in poured out, Your f[Dm7]inal breath that [Am]shook [G]the [F]ground
And You s[C]aid, â€œ[C/E]It is d[F]one,â€ and Your [Am]scars bear [F]witness: [G]It is finished.[C        | Am    F]

Verse 3:
I l[Dm7]ook into the H[F]oly Place and t[Gsus]hrough the open veil
I s[Dm7]ee my risen K[F]ing of grace who p[Gsus]leads my pardon still
My h[F]ealing in Your s[C/E]acrifice, my n[Dm7]ame within Your [Am]wounds [G]in - [F]scribed
And You s[C]ay, â€œ[C/E]You are m[F]ine,â€
And Your l[Am]ove bears [F]witness: [G]It is finished.[C        | Am    F    | C        | Am    F]

Verse 4:
I'll l[Dm7]ook into et[F]ernit[Am]y when s[Gsus]orrow's seas have dried
I'll s[Dm7]ee the Lamb who d[F]ied for m[Am]e in b[Gsus]eauty glorified
With o[F]pen arms, You'll b[C/E]ring me home to b[Dm7]ow in worship [Am]at [G]Your [F]throne
And You'll s[C/G]ay,  "[C/E]Come and r[F]est," as my h[Am]eart bears [F]witness: [G]It is finished.[G/F   F    | G/F   F]
And You'll s[C]ay,  "[C/E]Come and r[F]est," as my h[Am]eart bears [F]witness: [Gsus]It is [G]finished.   [C]
